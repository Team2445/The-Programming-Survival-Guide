Welcome to Kapolei Robotics team's programming subteam.

If you're here by choice, that's great hopefully you have a little programming experince and some of the documentation might be familiar to you, if not don't worry this website is for you to learn.

If you're not here by choice and Mr. K put you here, strap in and keep both arms and legs inside the vehicle. Get ready to learn things you probably have never seen before.
