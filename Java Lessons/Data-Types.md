# Data Types

### Like most programming languages, Java contains a handful of different types of data

#### The most common ones are:

## Integers

> They're the same like the ones in math, whole numbers

Examples:

```1, 2, 3, 4, 5, I think you get the picture...```

## Floats

> Also known as floating point numbers also known as decimals. These aren't used much (You'll find out why in a second), they're still here because of backwards compatibility.

Examples:

```1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.375, etc..```

## Doubles

> These are also decimals, however they can store more information compared to floats. They're called doubles because they can store double the amount of floats. If we ever need decimal numbers we'll be using this data type.

Examples:

```1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.375, etc..```

## Characters

> Characters are essentially all the keys on your keyboard and more. Think of it as a single letter (This will make more sense in a second). Usually defined by apostraphies ```''```

Examples:

```'a', 'b', 'c', '1', '2', '3', '.', ' '(space is also a character), '*', '/', etc..```

## Strings

> Strings are lists of characters. To put it more simply think of Strings as a sentence and how it contains letters and/or numbers in it. Usually defined by quotation marks ```""```

Examples:

```"hello", "one two three four", "1 2 3 4", "3.14159" (This is a string **NOT** a double), "        " (Yes a bunch of spaces is also a String since a space is a character), etc...```

## Arrays

> Arrays are lists of a certain data type and **ONLY** of that data type. They're usually defined by square brackets ```[]'s``` and sometimes ```{}'s```. (We'll go more in depth into this later).

Examples:

```{"Test", "One", "2", "***"}, {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}, {1.23, 3.14159, 24.45}```
