In every programming language there's different types of data. You interact with these different types of data everyday try making connections to things you use everyday and what you learn here. These are the basic data types.

#### Integers

> They're the same like the ones in math, whole numbers

Examples:

{% highlight java %}
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, // I think you get the picture...
{% endhighlight %}

#### Floats

> Also known as floating point numbers also known as decimals. These aren't used much (You'll find out why in a second), they're still here because of backwards compatibility.

Examples:

{% highlight java %}
1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.375, // etc..
{% endhighlight %}

#### Doubles

> These are also decimals, however they can store more information compared to floats. They're called doubles because they can store double the amount of floats. If we ever need decimal numbers we'll be using this data type.

Examples:

{% highlight java %}
1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.375, // etc..
{% endhighlight %}

#### Booleans

> Booleans have only two values, true or false. You can think of them as asking a regular true or false questions. If you don't like true/false questions then think of them as yes/no questions. Basically there's only two responses that you can use.

{% highlight java %}
true and false // that's it.
{% endhighlight %}

#### Characters

> Characters are essentially all the keys on your keyboard and more. Think of it as a single letter (This will make more sense in a second). Usually defined by apostraphies ```''```

Examples:

{% highlight java %}
'a', 'b', 'c', '1', '2', '3', '.', ' ' /*(space is also a character)*/, '*', '/', // etc..
{% endhighlight %}

#### Strings

> Strings are lists of characters. To put it more simply think of Strings as a sentence and how it contains letters and/or numbers in it. Usually defined by quotation marks ```""```

Examples:

{% highlight java %}
"hello", "one two three four", "1 2 3 4", "3.14159" /*(This is a string **NOT** a double)*/,
" " // (Yes a space is also a String since a space is a character), // etc...
{% endhighlight %}

#### Arrays

> Arrays are lists of a certain data type and **ONLY** of that data type. They're usually defined by square brackets ```[]'s``` and sometimes ```{}'s```. (We'll go more in depth into this later).

Examples:

{% highlight java %}
{"Test", "One", "2", "***"}, {'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o'}, {1.23, 3.14159, 24.45}
{% endhighlight %}
